# Wordle
THIS IS NOT THE REAL WORDLE!! This is a simple text-based Wordle-like game that I created for fun!

## Game Description

In this version of Wordle, you can create your own account, and play Wordle to your heart's content, unlike the official version which features a daily cap of just one word per day. Guess the 5-letter word within 6 tries, or you will fail! If you do fail, try again as many times as you want!

## How To Play

To play this game, you must follow these steps:

```
1.Clone the repository to your computer.
2.Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
3.Execute the wordle.py file.
4.That's it. Enjoy!
```
