# Wordle
THIS IS NOT THE REAL WORDLE!! This is a simple text-based Wordle-like game that I created for fun!

## Game Description

In this version of Wordle, you can create your own account, and play Wordle to your heart's content, unlike the official version which features a daily cap of just one word per day. Guess the 5-letter word within 6 tries, or you will fail! If you do fail, try again as many times as you want!

## How To Play

To play this game, you must follow these steps:

```
1.Clone the repository to your computer.
2.Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
3.Install the colorama package using pip install. (skip this step if the package is already installed)
4.Execute the wordle.py file.
5.That's it. Enjoy!
```
